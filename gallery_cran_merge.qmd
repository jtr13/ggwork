## Merge tidyverse gallery and cran page packages

Read in and merge the data on ggplot packages from the gallery and from the cran webpage to store in a new dataframe, packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

gallery_packages <- read_csv("generated_data/gallery_packages.csv")

cran_packages <- read_csv("generated_data/cran_packages.csv")

packages <- full_join(gallery_packages, cran_packages, by = c("package", "downloads"))
```

Sort by download count and save.

```{r}
sorted_packages <- arrange(packages, desc(downloads))

head(sorted_packages)
write_csv(sorted_packages, "generated_data/all_packages.csv")
```
