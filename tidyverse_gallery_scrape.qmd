# Tidyverse Gallery Scrape

The following code is designed to scrape the names of packages in the ggplot environment from the tidyverse gallery (https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/) and then retrieve the cumulative historical cran download count for each. It also scrapes the github star count listed for these packages.

First import the necessary packages:

```{r}
#| results: hide

library(tidyverse)
library(rvest) #html webscraping
library(packageRank) #to retrieve CRAN download counts
```

Read in the downloaded tidyverse gallery page html file. Must download webpage for the github star scrape to work properly.

```{r}
df <- read_html("raw_data/exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org.html")
```

Scrape the package names and store in a package_names vector.

```{r}
package_names <- df |>
  html_elements("div.card-content") |> 
  html_elements("span.card-title") |> 
  html_text()
```

The below function get_total_downloads takes in a package name and a date parameter to retrieve a cumulative count of that package's cran downloads up until that date by utilizing the cranDownloads function of packageRank.

```{r}
get_total_downloads <- function(pkg, date) {
  #to = 2025 pulls entire download history
  cd <- cranDownloads(packages = pkg, to = 2025) 
  
  #retrieving the 'cumulative' value of a particular date gets total download    count up to that date
  count <- cd$cranlogs.data$cumulative [ 
    cd$cranlogs.data$date == date 
  ]
  data.frame(package_name = pkg, cumulative_count = count)
}
```

To find the most current total historical download count, set a target_date of two days before today. Depending on the time of day, cranDownloads is updated to either 1 or 2 days previous to the current day.

```{r}
target_date <- Sys.Date()-2
```

Retrieve cran download count for each package by looping across package_names and store in a new vector called downloads_count. Directly passing in a package_names vector into cranDownloads function does not work properly. Will take a few minutes to complete.

```{r}
downloads_count <- numeric(length(package_names))

#cranDownloads sometimes will throw an error that terminates the loop if not handled properly
for (i in seq_along(package_names)) {
  dc <- tryCatch(
    get_total_downloads(package_names[i], target_date),
    
    #if the package is not found in cran return NA
    error = function(e) NA
  )
  downloads_count[i] <- ifelse(length(dc) == 0, NA, dc)
}
```

Scrape github star count from the gallery webpage.

```{r}
github_stars <- df |> 
  html_elements("span.github-btn") |>
  html_elements("a.gh-count") |> 
  html_text() |> as.numeric()
```

Store data in a new dataframe with a column indicating gallery as the source and export as csv.

```{r}
gallery_packages <- data.frame(package = package_names, stars = github_stars, downloads = downloads_count, gallery = TRUE)

head(gallery_packages)
write_csv(gallery_packages, "generated_data/gallery_packages.csv")
```
